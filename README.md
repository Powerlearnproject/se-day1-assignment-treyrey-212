#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high level quality software systems. Software engineering is important in the technology industry as it enables the creation of software applications that power various everyday operations in modern life such as communication, entertainment, commerce and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Key milestones in the evolution of software engineering include; the development of programming languages, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline the 1970s and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle includes the following phases;
Requirements- involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirenements.
Design- involves creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation- involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing- involves conducting various tests to ensure software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment- involves releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance - involves providing ongoing support , updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall methodology takes a sequential approach with distinct phases such as requirements flowing downwards like a waterfall while the Agile Methodology takes an iterative and incremental approach focused onflexibility, collaboration and responding to change. While the Waterfall methodology is rigid the Agile methodology is flexible. An example of a scenario where Waterfall methodology would be used is during a building of a website project. An exxample of a scenario where Agile methodology would be used is during creation of a mobile application project.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer writes code and implements software solutions.
A Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
A Project Manager oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code. An example is Visual Studio.
Version Control Systems (VSC) provide software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members. An example is Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Some common challenges faced by software engineers are; 
Changing requirements which often lead to scope creep and project delays.
Tight deadlines which can result to rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical debt which is accrued from shortcuts and can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
Strategies to overcome these challenges involve; effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is testing individual components of software.
Integration Testins is testing interactions betweeb different components of software.
System Testen is testing of the entire system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing is testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
The various types of testing in software quality assurance are importance as they help identify and fix defects early in development process, leading to higher quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the crafting of clear, specific and concise statements to AI. It is basically giving instructions to AI. The importance of prompt engineering in interacting with AI models is that it helps the interactions between humans and AI, the clearer the prompt the better and more efficient the response will be from AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
An example of a vague prompt is; Can you tell me about lakes.
An improved prompt that is clear, specific and concise is; Can you tell me about the salty lakes in Kenya.
The improved prompt is more effective because the statement is clear, specific and concise, this will enable the AI to not just provide a vague response on rivers but a focused and narrow answers about specifically salty lakes found in a specific region that is Kenya in a clear and concise manner.
